# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current chatbot integration in the grievance system lacks sophistication and user engagement features. Users need an intelligent, helpful assistant that can guide them through the grievance process with contextual responses, quick actions, and a professional interface that matches the quality of the original Material-UI implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the grievance system, I want an intelligent chatbot that can understand my questions and provide relevant, helpful responses about the grievance process, so that I can get assistance without needing to contact support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the chatbot THEN the system SHALL display a welcoming message with quick reply options
2. WHEN a user types a question about submitting grievances THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance with relevant navigation hints
3. WHEN a user asks about tracking status THEN the system SHALL explain the tracking process and provide direct links or instructions
4. WHEN a user asks about anonymity THEN the system SHALL clearly explain the anonymous submission process
5. IF a user's question is unclear THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions or suggest related topics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to have quick reply buttons and suggestions, so that I can quickly get answers to common questions without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot first opens THEN the system SHALL display quick reply buttons for common topics
2. WHEN a user clicks a quick reply button THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed response for that topic
3. WHEN the conversation progresses THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant follow-up actions or questions
4. WHEN a user completes an interaction THEN the system SHALL offer additional help options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to have a professional appearance with typing indicators and smooth interactions, so that the experience feels polished and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot is generating a response THEN the system SHALL display a typing indicator
2. WHEN messages are sent THEN the system SHALL show timestamps and proper message alignment
3. WHEN the chat window is opened THEN the system SHALL have a professional header with bot avatar and status
4. WHEN new messages arrive THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message
5. WHEN the user types THEN the system SHALL support multi-line input and Enter key submission

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to provide contextual help based on my current role and location in the system, so that I get relevant assistance for my specific situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the feedback submission page THEN the chatbot SHALL offer help specific to form completion
2. WHEN a user is on the status tracking page THEN the chatbot SHALL provide guidance on using tracking features
3. WHEN a user has a specific role (student, faculty, admin) THEN the chatbot SHALL tailor responses to that role's capabilities
4. WHEN a user asks for help THEN the system SHALL provide role-appropriate guidance and available actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to handle errors gracefully and provide fallback options, so that I always receive helpful responses even when the bot doesn't understand my question.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot cannot understand a user's question THEN the system SHALL provide helpful fallback responses with suggestions
2. WHEN a user asks about topics outside the grievance system THEN the system SHALL politely redirect to relevant topics
